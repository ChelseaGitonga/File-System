# File-System
### Project Summary:
fs (native node module) used to read and log the contents of a file(hello.txt) and thereafter used to copy the contents of the read file into another file(world.txt).
### fs methods used:
- .readFileSync();
- .copyFileSync();
### Languages and technologies:
- Node.js
- Unix Command Line
### Purpose: 
This project serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in using the Node.js file system module (fs). It showcases my understanding of different fs methods and how they can be used to read and manipulate files. The project specifically uses the .readFileSync() method to read the contents of a file named ‘hello.txt’ and logs the contents to the console. Then it uses the .copyFileSync() method to copy the contents of the read file into another file named ‘world.txt’. The project also demonstrates my understanding of using the command line interface to navigate and interact with the file system.
